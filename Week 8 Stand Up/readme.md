#### User Testing & Goals:
Before week 8 stand up workshop session, we have implemented a mock-ups prototype which in website style and invited 5 people from different industries as participants in our user testing session. Each participant will view the prototype firstly, and then we will have interviews with participants to talk about our project's prototype and gather user experience and feedback. For this time, our goals of prototype testing session, is to check whether participants could know the main functionality from website's prototype which could help us to figure what features might missing. On the other hand, we also wish to test about how participants would rate our application's interface. Since user interface is directly relatived with user experience when they use our application.

This website prototype was made by Adobe Experience Design CC(Beta)

Process to use prototype:
- First take a look of front page of our website
- Click 'About us' to know who are us and what does this website do
- Click 'Skills search', and suppose you are seeking some one who contains great skills in programming.
- Simple click on blank type area which simulate you are actually type something into. And then click search

#### Target users/audience:
Our target users are those who intended to start up a business and look for business idea/ business partner/ investor. 


#### Structure of the testing survey:
-	Problem Space: Idea of the user background in order to compare with our target audience. 
-	Design Functionality: Interaction with the core functionality of the interface by searching a skill for an industry.
-	Design Aesthetic: General idea of their reaction towards the design and aesthetic of the interface.
-	Sustainability: How the users react to continuous use of the application and their reaction towards the system.
