#### User Testing & Goals:
Before week 8 stand up workshop session, we have implemented a mock-ups prototype which in website style and invited 5 people from different industries as participants in our user testing session. Each participant will view the prototype firstly, and then we will have interviews with participants to talk about our project's prototype and gather user experience and feedback. For this time, our goals of prototype testing session, is to check whether participants could know the main functionality from website's prototype which could help us to figure what features might missing. On the other hand, we also wish to test about how participants would rate our application's interface. Since user interface is directly relatived with user experience when they use our application.

This website prototype was made by Adobe Experience Design CC(Beta)

Process to use prototype:
- First take a look of front page of our website
- Click 'About us' to know who are us and what does this website do
- Click 'Skills search', and suppose you are seeking some one who contains great skills in programming.
- Simple click on blank type area which simulate you are actually type something into. And then click search
- Look how many results which fit your needs.
- Finally click any pages you would like to know. (Login page/ Inbox page/ Discussion Forum page)





#### Target users/audience:
Our target users are those who intended to start up a business and look for business idea/ business partner/ investor. 


#### Structure of the testing survey:
-	Problem Space: Idea of the user background in order to compare with our target audience. 
-	Design Functionality: Interaction with the core functionality of the interface by searching a skill for an industry.
-	Design Aesthetic: General idea of their reaction towards the design and aesthetic of the interface.
-	Sustainability: How the users react to continuous use of the application and their reaction towards the system. 


#### Testing results & survey results: 

This is our survey link https://goo.gl/forms/CmIsBhdRckqasn0t1
Some users have given us useful feedback from survey. These feedbacks were about the functionality and interface design of our application. Some of the users were doubt about the account problem as they wanted account to have some identification and verification.

In this survey we also collected some demographics about users to make a comparison with our target audience. Most of the users are student and some of them have casual work. In this prototype testing, our users were from different industries and most of them would like to start their own business and willing to use our platform.

Interface feedbacks:

> “This interface is very simple and clean. I like hows the search box working as it will show result in list with relevant information.” 

> "First impression of interface is nice and clean. But colour of text in front page is not appropriate in my personal view. Hope more function will be implemented in next time"


#### Conclusion

Our product could be an application that able to help adult people with their start-up business. They could be either looking for idea or business partners since all of our interviewees willing to get an idea or a partner as the first step of start-up business. Some of them may want to have a try on our product, but the ideas security of our application and usability of current prototype could limit our user.

From this user test, we are able to find the following issues that need to be enhanced.

- Validation of user’s identity: People are always afraid to do business or share their mind with a stranger. A validation of user’s identity such as photo ID could help the user be more trustful.


- Validation of user’s certificates

People may choose their start-up partner because of their their professional knowledge and skills.  A validation of user’s certificates is necessary.


- Login system

About login system, user may want to know what is the privilege of becoming a member of our website. We need to think about the difference between the pages viewing by a member and a visitor. 


- The color & text

Some interviewees have some complaint about the color. A little improvement about the design could be necessary in the future. In addition, we could reduce the saturation of some parts of UI in order to make user feel more comfortable.


- Filter of searching function

A filter with more choice will be definitely helpful for the user experience.




#### Milestones before next stand up:
- Design a new questionnaire and post it to slack and other community place for larger range of users and data will be collect and analyse. 
- Do more research about existing solution to improve our project
- Implement new prototype and update functionality
