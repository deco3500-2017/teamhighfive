The aim of this research is to find out what are the exisiting solution from these websites provided for our target audience: business owner, start-up entrepreneur, investor and individual who seeking for partnership or job. It also explained the function of each website compared to the function which we will provided for our target audience. This research have given us more idea for improvement of our concept.

### Final Conclusion
## Requirements:

### Problem:

Many young entrepreneurs and students have brilliant business ideas that they wish to start. However, they lack the funds to start over or they are simply in need for a partnership with some other skill set. It has always been a challenge to find a platform dedicated to the needs of young entrepreneurs. Thus, this forms the rationale of the project; a dedicated business platform to allow people to form partnerships, discuss and form businesses.

### Solution:

The project aims to fill in the gap between Indeed and BusinessPartners, that are primarily focused on employment and crowdfunding respectively. Thus, it is different from Indeed as it is not focused on employment but rather the initial startup phase of a business which includes forming partnerships, sharing and discussing confidential ideas under strict confidentiality.

Our project also differs from BusinessPartners as we do not rely on crowdfunding and employment but rather sharing idea by mutual agreement between two or more parties. The project will harness the power of social and mobile computing to achieve its aims. An online website will be established that provides its users with a directory search of user profiles, discussion forums, messenger, partnership formation.

On the other side, users can search for the partners base on their requirement in 'Partner search' section. For example, Business owners can search contributors with certain occupation category to find suitable people and view their user profiles. And investor can search for their most interested business idea in this section to decide the most profitable project to invest.
