### Individual work: 
**Mehroz Abbasi** - Completed a draft of promotional plan, a small brochure booklet (draft) and ideas on how to best promote through and if we require videos, posters, etc. *My task for next:*

**Hui Ee Chua** – Before the week 10 stand up, I did some [research]( https://github.com/deco3500-2017/teamhighfive/blob/master/Week%2010%20stand%20up/research.md) about competitor and existing solution to improve our concept. In the research document, I’ve analysed the function of website from three competitors (indeed.com, jobsearch.gov.au, businesspartners.com) compared to our concept. I also wrote a [user testing protocol](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/teamhighfive/blob/master/Week%2010%20stand%20up/User%20Testing%202/usertesting-protocol.md), designed a [questionnaire](https://goo.gl/forms/VHBIwYqgkEk421xG3
) and [consent form]( https://github.com/deco3500-2017/teamhighfive/blob/master/Week%2010%20stand%20up/User%20Testing%202/Informed%20consent%20form.pdf) for user testing. *My task for next: do user testing, draw a diagram flow for our website*

### What's next:

In the week 10 stand up workshop, Lorna and other tutors have given us some useful feedback about our concept, their suggestion will be considered to improve our project. The changes that made will be added to our [concept document]( https://github.com/deco3500-2017/teamhighfive/blob/master/README.md) soon. Our prototype will be changed due to the feedback and user testing will be taken as soon as possible when we have a new functional prototype.
