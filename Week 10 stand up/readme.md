### Individual work: 
**Mehroz Abbasi** - In week 10, I have been doing research on how to best promote our product. As planned, I got started on a draft plan for our promotional campaign and the materials which include a small brochure booklet, poster, and a screen video of the performing website. Further ideas will be noted if required as we go along. *My task for next:* Having done extensive research on viable promotional options and a draft plan, I will now be able to execute it and actually build the promotional material to its final form. The draft plan may be redefined as we go along. Thus, based on this week's plannning, the next time the promotional video will be recorded along with all other promotional material ready (poster, borchure booklet and video at this stage).

**Hui Ee Chua** – Before the week 10 stand up, I did some [research]( https://github.com/deco3500-2017/teamhighfive/blob/master/Week%2010%20stand%20up/research.md) about competitor and existing solution to improve our concept. In the research document, I’ve analysed the function of website from three competitors (indeed.com, jobsearch.gov.au, businesspartners.com) compared to our concept. I also wrote a [user testing protocol](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/teamhighfive/blob/master/Week%2010%20stand%20up/User%20Testing%202/usertesting-protocol.md), designed a [questionnaire](https://goo.gl/forms/VHBIwYqgkEk421xG3
) and [consent form]( https://github.com/deco3500-2017/teamhighfive/blob/master/Week%2010%20stand%20up/User%20Testing%202/Informed%20consent%20form.pdf) for user testing. *My task for next: do user testing, draw a diagram flow for our website*

**Kaho Ha** - The latest upgrade of prototype before week 10 stand up is to meet previous participants' needs and want. Which upgraded digital prototype to be more functionality. After implemented prototype, I've done one user testing with participants which is my father (He is looking for start a new business.). Also, I did a quick interview about his opinion after using our website. *My task for next:*

**Haoxiang Zheng** - 

*My task for next:*

**Yaxin Cui** - In week 10, my main duty is user testing and I have done some research




### What's next:

In the week 10 stand up workshop, Lorna and other tutors have given us some useful feedback about our concept, their suggestion will be considered to improve our project. The changes that made will be added to our [concept document]( https://github.com/deco3500-2017/teamhighfive/blob/master/README.md) soon. Our prototype will be changed due to the feedback and user testing will be taken as soon as possible when we have a new functional prototype.
