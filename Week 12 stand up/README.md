Mehroz Abbasi | For week 12, I was assigned for the implementation of promotion materials after careful consideration of the material suitable for our project. I made the 6-page long project brochure and an A1 poster as required. I also got them printed and arranged at the UQ POD. Furthermore, I wrote the instructions on how to use the prototype. 
Hui Ee Chua | Before the week 12 stand up, I have done the user interview and user testing with our potential target audience. In my [user interview](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/teamhighfive/blob/master/Week%2012%20stand%20up/User_interview_%26_testing.md) document, it explains the user background, her process of starting up a new business, what are the challenges she faced from her business and what is her plan for solving these difficulties. 
Kaho Ha | Things changed in project prototype: 1. comprehense registration page to be more detail, and users ID or IC need to be verified. 2. Allow more roles of users could involve in our website, previously we only categorise users into employer and employee. For now, we have business owner, business seeker, investor, service provider and students. 3. Base on second change, I also implement more pages about skill search pages. users could search other kinds of partners instead of only job seekers. 4. In discussion forum, business owners could share idea on that, and every users could leave their comments and click 'like' if they fall interested in.

Yaxin Cui | I have done the user interview, all are our potential target audience. And here are the thing is useful. Verify each step, like register with really IC, verify the certificate. Build a like button show how many people interested in this startup.  Then, the user can use more service if they have higher credit about trustworthiness. Add comment section for each startup post. Next, it can have one more feedback section but this one is optional. All the interview detail and summary can be found in [there](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/teamhighfive/blob/master/Week%2012%20stand%20up/user%20interview_WEEK12.pdf) And I have done the Observation User Testing  (https://github.com/deco3500-2017/teamhighfive/blob/master/Week%2012%20stand%20up/Prototype%20Observation%20Task_Testing.pdf)
There are 5 tasks for the tester to complete and I write down the observation result in this doc, noted down if there are any usability problem for our product.Then, I also require the tester to complete the survey. 
Haoxiang Zheng | I kept updating our web prototype in these weeks. I am implementing the user login system and search function using hard code data set to make it become a revealable prototype. Since we won't use database in this project. There are some problem in achieving these effect. I am trying to use pure frontend code such as AngularJS to solve that. https://deco3500-2017.github.io/teamhighfive/
