Mehroz Abbasi | For week 12, I was assigned for the implementation of promotion materials after careful consideration of the material suitable for our project. I made the 6-page long project [brochure](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/teamhighfive/blob/master/Week%2012%20stand%20up/DECO%20Brochure.pdf) and an [A1 poster](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/teamhighfive/blob/master/Week%2012%20stand%20up/DECO%20A1%20Poster.pdf) as required. I also got them printed and arranged at the UQ POD. Furthermore, I wrote the instructions on how to use the prototype. 
Hui Ee Chua | Before the week 12 stand up, I have done the user interview and user testing with our potential target audience. In my [user interview](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/teamhighfive/blob/master/Week%2012%20stand%20up/User_interview_%26_testing.md) document, it explains the user background, her process of starting up a new business, what are the challenges she faced from her business and what is her plan for solving these difficulties. 
Kaho Ha | Things changed in project prototype: 1. comprehense registration page to be more detail, and users ID or IC need to be verified. 2. Allow more roles of users could involve in our website, previously we only categorise users into employer and employee. For now, we have business owner, business seeker, investor, service provider and students. 3. Base on second change, I also implement more pages about skill search pages. users could search other kinds of partners instead of only job seekers. 4. In discussion forum, business owners could share idea on that, and every users could leave their comments and click 'like' if they fall interested in.

Yaxin Cui | I have done the user interview, all are our potential target audience. And here are the useful feedback from my interview. 1.Verify each step, like register with really IC, verify the certificate. 2.Build a like button show how many people interested in this startup.  3.Then, the user can use more service if they have higher credit about trustworthiness. 4.Add comment section for each startup post. 5.Next, it can have one more feedback section but this one is optional. All the interview detail and summary can be found in [there](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/teamhighfive/blob/master/Week%2012%20stand%20up/User%20interview%20document_week12.pdf) And I have done the [Observation User Testing](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/teamhighfive/blob/master/Week%2012%20stand%20up/Observation_Prototype_User%20Testing.pdf) There are 5 tasks for the tester to complete and I write down the observation result in this doc, noted down if there are any usability problem for our product.Then, I also require the tester to complete the survey. 
Haoxiang Zheng | I kept updating our web prototype in these weeks. I am implementing the user login system and search function using hard code data set to make it become a revealable prototype. Since we won't use database in this project. There are some problem in achieving these effect. I am trying to use pure frontend code such as AngularJS to solve that. https://deco3500-2017.github.io/teamhighfive/




### How to use our prototype:

**_Sign-up_**

![Figure 1](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/teamhighfive/blob/master/Week%2012%20stand%20up/figure1.png)

In order to use the website, you will need to sign up as a user first. Please click the Sign- up button on the top menu bar as shown in figure 1. Please fill up the required information as accurately as possible, this will help identify you best by the community.

After signing up, you might want to check your inbox for a welcome message along with brief instructions on how to use the website. Your personal inbox allows you to send and receive private messages from other users in the community. 

**_Your profile_** 

![Figure 2](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/teamhighfive/blob/master/Week%2012%20stand%20up/figure2.png)

You can message other users by clicking their avatar. For instance, you may find other users in the discussion forums or the skills search list. You may also view and edit your own profile by clicking the “Profile’ button on the top bar (figure 1). As other users will be viewing your profile to know more about you, it is essential to keep your profile up-to-date with accurate information. Figure 2 shows the interface of a profile.

**_Discussion forums_**

As a new user, you are highly encouraged to introduce yourself in the community discussion forums. You can access the discussion forum by navigating through the top bar as shown in figure 1. Once in the forums, you can click the “Welcome New Users” thread and post general information such as your first name, country and reasons for joining the community.

**_Community profiles_**

![Figure 3](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/teamhighfive/blob/master/Week%2012%20stand%20up/figure3.png)

You can check more about the user who posted above you by clicking on “More info” under their name as illustrated in figure 3. Moreover, you can click “Chat” to initiate a private conversation. Notice that the #hashtags represent the user’s interests as described in their profiles, e.g. #IT 


**_Skill search_** 

![Figure 4](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/teamhighfive/blob/master/Week%2012%20stand%20up/figure4.png)

After familiarisation with the system, you may want to pursue your goals of finding a business partner and ultimately becoming a co-founder of a new venture. You may take on the role of an investor with an original idea or contribute in-demand skills for a listed venture. The people who bring in the demanded skills are referred as the “job-seekers” in the system. Figure 4 illustrates how the skills search results might look like.
As a job seeker, your profile must be up-to-date with the relevant skill domains included as #hashtags, e.g. #python. The hashtags will make you searchable by potential business investors who may choose to contact you based on your skills. You can also search a list of new businesses and communicate with their respective owners/investors for potential partnerships. You must discuss how you can contribute in terms of skills as a ‘job seeker’. You may also set up your own business idea in search for potential investors. 
 
As an investor searching for skill sets, you must navigate to the “Skills Search” in the top bar and type the required skills. A list of people with the searched skills will be displayed as a result, as illustrated in figure 4.
