Hui Ee Chua | Before the week 12 stand up, I have done the user interview and user testing with our potential target audience. In my [user interview](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/teamhighfive/blob/master/Week%2012%20stand%20up/User_interview_%26_testing.md) document, it explains the user background, her process of starting up a new business, what are the challenges she faced from her business and what is her plan for solving these difficulties. 
Kaho Ha | Things changed in project prototype: 1. comprehense registration page to be more detail, and users ID or IC need to be verified. 2. Allow more roles of users could involve in our website, previously we only categorise users into employer and employee. For now, we have business owner, business seeker, investor, service provider and students. 3. Base on second change, I also implement more pages about skill search pages. users could search other kinds of partners instead of only job seekers. 4. In discussion forum, business owners could share idea on that, and every users could leave their comments and click 'like' if they fall interested in.
